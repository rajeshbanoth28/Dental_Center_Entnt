- **React (Functional Components)**
- **React Router**
- **Context API**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **localStorage** for data persistence
- **File uploads** (base64 or Blob URLs)

##  Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dental-center-entnt.git
   cd dental-center-entnt
   ```

2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app locally  
   ```bash
   npm run dev   # or npm start (if using CRA)
   ```

---

##  Sample Credentials

```json
Admin:
  Email: admin@entnt.in
  Password: admin123

Patient:
  Email: john@entnt.in
  Password: patient123
```

---

##  Simulated Data

All data is stored in `localStorage`. JSON mock data includes users, patients, and incidents (appointments), with support for base64/Blob file uploads.

---

##  Technical Decisions

- Used **Context API** instead of Redux to keep things simple.
- **Tailwind CSS** chosen for fast, responsive UI development.
- Simulated **auth & data** using `localStorage` as backend is not allowed.

---

##  Known Issues

- No backend: data resets on clearing browser storage
- File uploads use base64, which can slow down large files

---

##  Submission

- Email the **GitHub repo** and **deployed link** to: `hr@entnt.in`
- Deadline: **Monday, 8 July**
